Developing an online shopping system named "Fashion Wear" using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) technologies can result in a dynamic and scalable e-commerce platform.

"Fashion Wear" will be an e-commerce platform where users can browse, search, and purchase fashionable clothing and accessories. The system will include features for user authentication, product management, shopping cart functionality, payment processing(BrainTree), and order management.

Technologies Used:

MongoDB:
Database for storing product information, user data, orders, and other relevant data.
Utilize MongoDB's flexibility to handle unstructured data and scale as the application grows.

Express.js:
Web application framework for building the server-side application.
Handle HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and interacting with the MongoDB database.

React.js:
JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Create interactive and responsive front-end components for the e-commerce website.

Node.js:
JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
Use Node.js to build the backend server, handle business logic, and serve API endpoints.

Components:

User Authentication:
Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
Implement authentication mechanisms using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.

Product Management:
Enable admins to add, edit, and delete products.
Implement CRUD operations for managing product listings in the database.

Shopping Cart:
Users can add products to their cart, update quantities, and remove items.
Persist cart data across sessions using cookies or local storage.

Payment Processing:
Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Braintree, PayPal) to securely process payments.
Implement checkout functionality with options for credit/debit card payments, PayPal, etc.

Order Management:
Users can view their order history and track the status of their orders.
Admins can manage orders, update order status, and generate reports.
Search and Filtering:

Implement search functionality to allow users to find products by name, category, or keywords.
Provide filtering options to narrow down search results based on price, size, color, etc
